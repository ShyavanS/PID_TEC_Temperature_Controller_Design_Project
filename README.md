# PID_TEC_Temperature_Controller_Design_Project
Final Design Project for an Engineering Physics course on programming microcontrollers and embedded systems at McMaster University. A PID temperature controller project for a Peltier thermoelectric cooler (TEC) using the Seebeck effect that runs on the TI MSP430 microcontroller with the aid of a MATLAB script running on a PC to provide a user interface and perform PID calculations. 

This design project involved using an MSP430 microcontroller in conjunction with MATLAB to acheive PID control of the temperature of an object as part of the ENGPHYS 3BB3 course at McMaster University as a culminating task to represent our understanding of topics covered in the course.
